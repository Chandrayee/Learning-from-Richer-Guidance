The three main programs are baseline.py, cirlf_noeps.py, cirlf_eps.py. 
Baseline is one-step comparison queries taken from the work Dorsa Sadigh and reuses some of her codes. 
Dorsa's repository is here: https://github.com/dsadigh/driving-preferences
cirlf_eps.py and cirlf_noeps.py are two versions comparison-based learning with feature queries
The programs use pywren to parallelize the runs in python. More information
